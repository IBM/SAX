# Towards Causal Business Process Discovery
## Abstract
AI-Augmented business process systems are a new type of process-aware information systems capable of reasoning and explaining the decisions and outcomes of the business process executions as they occur.
This is challenging as such systems' behavior possesses a high degree of autonomy and flexibility, reflected by ad-hoc and data driven process models. Contemporary process mining algorithms exploit time precedence as their main source of model derivation. Such reliance can sometimes be deceiving from a causal perspective. This calls for faithful new techniques to discover the true execution dependencies among the tasks in the process. 
This work is a first step towards detecting the conditions under which process mining algorithms generate a model that is incongruent with the model generated by causal discovery techniques, and shows how the latter model can be methodologically leveraged for a sound analysis of the process. Our methodology searches for such discrepancies between the two models in the context of the confounder causal condition, and derives an additional view in which these inconsistencies are annotated over the process model. 
We demonstrate our methodology employing two open process mining algorithms, the IBM Process Mining tool, and the LiNGAM causal discovery technique. We apply it on a synthesized dataset and on a Hospital ER Sepsis benchmark dataset.
