# Model-informed LIME Extension for BusinessProcess Explainability
## Abstract
> Our focus in this work is on the adaptation of eXplainable AI
> techniques for the interpretation of business process execution results. 
> Such adaptation is required since conventional employment of suchtechniques
> involves a surrogate machine learning model that is trained on historical process
> executionlogs. However, being a data-driven surrogate, its representation
> faithfulness of the real business process model affects the adequacy of the 
> explanations derived from it.  Hence, native use of such techniquesis not 
> ensured to be adhering to the target business process explained. 
> We present a business-process-model-driven approach that extends LIME,
> a conventional machine-learning-model-agnostic eXplain-able AI tool,
> to cope with business processes constraints that is replicable and reproducible. 
> Our results show that our extended LIME approach produces correct and significantly 
> more adequate explanationsthan the ones given by LIME as-is.
